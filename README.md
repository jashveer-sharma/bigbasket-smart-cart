# 🛒 BigBasket Smart Cart – Hackathon Prototype 🚀

> An **AI-powered grocery shopping assistant** that solves real-world e-grocery problems like incomplete carts, poor recommendations, stock issues, and delayed refunds.
> Built for **InnoVateX 2025 Hackathon** ✨

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Current online grocery apps (like BigBasket) face challenges:

* ❌ Users forget essentials → **incomplete carts → multiple orders**
* ❌ Items marked available later turn **out of stock**
* ❌ **Poor recommendations** (irrelevant items shown)
* ❌ **Delayed refunds** for missing/undelivered products
* ❌ Cart often **clears on logout / session timeout**
* ❌ **Complicated returns** for perishable goods

---

## 💡 Our Solution – Smart Cart Features

✅ **Smart Auto-Cart** – Auto-fills missing essentials (milk, oil, rice, salt) from past history
✅ **Recipe-to-Cart** – Type a dish (“Paneer Butter Masala”) → AI adds ingredients
✅ **Cart Guard** – Cloud-synced cart, never lost on logout
✅ **Smart Related Items** – Contextual suggestions (Banana → Peanut Butter, Oats)
✅ **Stock Checker** – Warns if items are unavailable before checkout
✅ **Instant Refunds** – < 1 min auto-refund demo flow
✅ **Notify Me** – Alerts when out-of-stock items are back
